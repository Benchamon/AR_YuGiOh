# AR_YuGiOh
AR project made for augmented reality class.

This project consists of taking visual input of "targets" (image, patterns, etc.) and overlaying digital content.
By puting a card in front of the cvamera, the computer recognizes it as a target and displays the related contenten on top of it.

The main idea is to take the card game "Yu-Gi-Oh" to a virtual world by implementing 3d models and animations, at the moment there are only a few 3d models but all cards have a HD sprite of itself.
